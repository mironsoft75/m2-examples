Plugins
-------
With Plugins you get access to the variables before they are given to a function, 
and you get access to the return value before it is sent to the caller.

UseProxy
--------
You can delay initialization of classes until they are really used. That is done with a proxy.
No need to change any code at all, just configure in di.xml that you want this on some class injections. Magento take care of the rest. This can Improove performance!!.

Factory
-------
With a factory object you can create new empty objects of a specific type.
For example when you want to create new customers or products.
This example is also about singleton (shared objects).

Events
------
You can dispatch events and attach any data. In your observer you get READ ONLY data that you can act on.
If you need to send data back, then use a plugin instead.
